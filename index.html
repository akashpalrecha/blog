I work as an **AI Researcher** in a Space-tech startup (*Pixxel*) that is building a constellation of earth-imaging small satellites ðŸ›° to provide an entirely new kind of dataset of the earth that todayâ€™s satellites arenâ€™t capable of.

*Alongside Pixxel, I am currently a pre-final year MSc. Mathematics student in Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.*

I like tackling big, high impact problems. One such problem I believe in is *making AI accessible*. I am greatly influenced by Jeremy Howardâ€™s (Co-Founder, Fast.ai) approach to AI and my belief in making AI accessible stems from Fast.aiâ€™s core philisophy of making neural nets uncool again.
