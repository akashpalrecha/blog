I'm currently remotely working as a **Visiting Undergraduate Research Intern** at *Harvard University's [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu) under professor [Hanspeter Pfister](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people)*. I will be working to help build the next generation high-throughput computational electron microscope by using deep learning to enhance the imageing capabilities. 

I also recently became a **FastAI International Fellow**.

In my free time, I am a part-time **AI Researcher** in a Space-tech startup ([Pixxel](https://www.pixxel.space)) where I work on using unsupervised and supervised deep models to gather insights from hyperspectral satellite imagery. I was previously a **Team Lead** for the AI team at Pixxel.

*Alongside Pixxel, I am currently a pre-final year MSc. (Hons.) Mathematics student in Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.*

I like tackling big, high impact problems. One such problem I believe in is *making AI accessible*. I am greatly influenced by Jeremy Howard’s (Co-Founder, Fast.ai) approach to AI and my belief in making AI accessible stems from Fast.ai’s core philisophy of making neural nets uncool again.

P.S.: The *About Me* page hasn't been updated in a while. It's on my TODO!
